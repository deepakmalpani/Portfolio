# Portfolio Website

This is the source code for my personal portfolio website. The website showcases my skills, projects, and experience as a full-stack developer. It includes sections for an introduction, a list of projects, and contact information.

## Purpose

The purpose of this portfolio website is to provide a platform where potential employers, clients, and collaborators can learn more about my work and get in touch with me.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The website is fully responsive and works well on all devices, from desktops to mobile phones.
- **Download Resume**: Visitors can download my resume directly from the website.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express
- **Hosting**: Vercel

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
